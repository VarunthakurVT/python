#loop is used to exicute the code of block multiple times without rewriting it
# like if we want to write 
# there are two types of loop 
# for and while 
# for loop work on the basis of the number or we can say the range
# while loop work on the basis of the condition
# There is a range in the for loop 
# range function work as (starting index,ending index,stapsize) like these all things 

# for i in range(1,21,1):
#     print(i)

# this is for the forword loop if you want to it make backword do step size to -ve like
# for i in range(43,1,-1):
#     print(i)

# we can use loop in the string
# a="varun Tharkur" 
# print(len(a))
# for i in range(len(a)):
#     print(a[i])

# we can do this like this also 
a="varun Tharkur" 

for i in a:
    print(i)
